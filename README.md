# SimToolBox
A toolbox for object-tracking simulation. 
This toolbox contains a collection of useful tools for different tasks involved in a particle-tracking type simulation.

At the base level the code relies on `FDPS` and `Trilinos`.
The folder `FDPS` contains the headers to the [Framework for Developing Particle Simulator](`https://github.com/FDPS/FDPS`).
The folder `Trilinos` contains an interface to [the huge C++ project](https://trilinos.github.io/) for distributed linear algebra and some other useful stuff.

The folder `Collision` contains the routines for LCP based collision resolution algorithms, supporting both OpenMP and MPI through `Trilinos`.

The folder `Particle` contains a parallel `ParticleSystem` class for simulating rigid spherocylinders with overdamped dynamics. A geometric constraint optimization method is implemented to resolve collisions. Parallel IO is also supported for each geometric primitive through the XML-based vtk routines. This code is used in my publications:

The folder `Util` contains some utilities to facilitate the application, including an interface to linear algebra `Eigen`, a parallel RNG interface to `TRNG`, a command line parser `cmdparser` (https://github.com/FlorianRappl/CmdParser), a timer.

New functions will be continuously added to this toolbox to facilitate quick development of HPC simulation code.
Run the script `Gendoc.sh` to generate html document with doxygen in `doc/html/index.html`.
Read `StepByStep.md` for instructions.
